These updates incorporate feedback collected from recent hires who expressed concerns about unclear expectations during their initial weeks.\n\nUnder the revised process, supervisors must schedule structured check-in meetings during a new employee's first month. These meetings should address training progress, workplace integration, and any immediate questions the employee may have.\n\nTo support the updated approach, the Division will release new onboarding guides, provide mandatory supervisor workshops, and introduce standardized documentation forms.",
